NMR Beyond Li: New Approaches in Studying Na, Mg and Li-air Batteries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- SEI closes pores, leading to capacity fade.

- Na NMR is promising, Mg is challenging

~~~~~~~~~
Questions
~~~~~~~~~

Q: It looks similar to MIT results, but...
    A: It is not in the high-current regime,
    but there is a transition from moss to dendrite
    that occurs even at low current.

Q: Bonding?
    A: Disrupts long-range ordering of Mn\ :sup:`3+` / Mn\ :sup:`4+`.
    Sodium is moving very fast. Prismatic sites.

Q: Spatial resolution of NMR?
    A: Faster ions means worse resolution. Pulse field gradients.
    About 10 micron in slow case, 100 micron in fast case.

Operando Techniques to Probe Battery Materials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Surface: SEM, XPS, Raman

- Bulk: XRD, XAS, Mössbauer

- Often 1st and 2nd cycles are well studied,
  and the rest tend to be neglected.

- Need reliable electrochemistry for long-term study.

  - Pressure, air/moisture tight, design

- Both neutron and x-ray diffraction

  - neutron diffraction:

    - weak matter/neutron interaction (need lots of active material)

    - lots of incoherent scattering of hydrogen

    - cylindrical cell design

      - normal cell is 6-7 mg/cm\ :sup:`2`,
        neutron cell is 20 mg/cm\ :sup:`2`

- LNMO vs. graphite

  - peaks are present from:

    - LNMO
    - Al foil
    - Cu foil
    - graphite
    - Al\ :sub:`2`\ O\ :sub:`3`

    - Despite this, Rietveld analysis is still possible.

  - Not all lithium comes back after 1st cycle

    - Roughly 7% lost in 1st cycle due to surface reaction.

- What about long-term cycling?

  - comparison of 1st cycle to 100th cycle for cathode.

  - lithium is not in cathode. Maybe lost in anode?

  - comparison for anode diffraction: lithium not in anode, either.

- Slow cycling is required for operando study.

  - Unfortunate, because processes are different at high rate.

  - One way around this: stroboscopic mode

    - Commercial |LiFePO4| at more than 9C rate.

      - Difficult to understand.

    - LNMO at faster rate: looks same as slow rate.

- Beryllium window and mechanical pressure?

  - put it under vacuum

  - 30°C - 50°C?

  - |Li2MnO3| at 30°C

    - amorphization and |O2| release

  - |Li2MnO3| at 50°C

    - amorphization and |O2| release
    - not reversible

- Li-S battery (long-term cycling)

  - liquid polysulfides resolvable

  - more and more amorphization in long-term cycling

- See `poster 1011`_

Visualization of Electrochemical Reactions in Battery Materials with X-ray Microscopy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- X-ray microscopy: cousin of TEM

  - transmission x-ray microscopy (full-field)

  - scanning TXM

    - do XANES as well
    - deeper penetration than TEM
    - do linear combination fit at every 30 nm pixel

  - drawback: spatial resolution worse than TEM

- Results:

  - |LiFePO4| microparticle fracture upon delithiation

    - But where?

  - X-ray ptychography

    - don't use lenses, reconstruct image with software
    - full diffraction, not Bragg diffraction
    - limited by x-ray wavelength, not lens resolving power
    - about 3 nm resolution

  - virtually no fractures on nanoplates

- Mn\ :sub:`2`\ O\ :sub:`4` as a "two-electron" material

  - 280 mAh/g is the practical limit for cathodes today

    - Thackeray (1997) https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0079-6786(97)81003-5

    - strain, fracture, loss of electrical contact

    - tetragonal to cubic, cubic to cubic

    - phases that are 1V apart co-exist in a single particle

~~~~~~~~~~
Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

- phase transformation are as important as diffusion

- visualize multiple single particles with these techniques

~~~~~~~~~
Questions
~~~~~~~~~

Q: Time resolution?
    A: Depending on chemical resolution, seconds to minutes

Q: Multiple phases?
    A: Reference spectrum and linear combination fitting?

    A: This is typical for the materials; maybe change in conductivity or diffusion?

Q: Cation reorganization? Did you also do XRD/Rietveld?
    A: Yes, similar trend as magnetic. We have calculated magnetic moment;
    corresponds to changes due to doping.

Designing and Realizing Higher Energy Density Multivalent Cathodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- positive metal host and negative metal

- site limited, not redox limited

- cathode: 1 Li, max 280 mAh/g

- anode: 700 mAh/g

- Problems:

  - electrolytes

  - only one reversible cathode:

    - described by Aurbach

    - Chevrel phase, Mo\ :sub:`6`\ X\ :sub:`8` (low V)

- Aurbach: magnesium electrochemistry

- multivalent: harder to move from site to site

- methodology: 1st principles DFT

  - fast evaluation of average voltage, capacity, estimated 'stability'

    - https://materialsproject.org/ (hundreds/day)

  - mobility along percolation paths

    - takes a long time to calculate (one/day)

  - plot:

    - x-axis: gravimetric capacity (mAh/g)
    - y-axis: voltage v. respective metal
    - Zn: low V
    - Mg: good
    - Ca: even better

  - but the bottleneck is *mobility*

- tetrahedral to octahedral to tetrahedral

- cation coordination preferences

  - Brown, Acta Cryst 1988 https://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S0108768188007712

  - Mg\ :sup:`2+` 0.72 Å
  - Li\ :sup:`+` 0.76 Å
  - Zn\ :sup:`2+` 0.74 Å
  - Ca\ :sup:`2+` 1.10 Å

  - Liu et al., 2015 https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C4EE03389B

  - Rong et al., 2015 https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b02342

  - Zn and Mg have same size and valence,
    but activation barriers are very different.

- intercalation, not conversion or corrosion reactions

  - verified by XRD, STM, etc. (Jordi Cabana)

- the energy barrier from tetrahedral to octahedral is difficult to change

  - can try to reduce it by e.g. switching from oxide to sulfide

- Ti\ :sub:`2`\ S\ :sub`4` spinel: good host for Mg

- |Zn2+| in layered has about 500 meV,
  similar to |Li+| in spinel,
  so |Zn2+| should be able to pass through the structure easily:
  about 170 mAh/g at 0.& V vs Zn over 1000 cycles.

  - capacity returns to about 130 mAh/g at high rates

- Mg doesn't like tetrahedral 4-fold coordination,
  looks for activated octahedral,
  but lack of it improves mobility.
  Borderline diffusion.

- Olivine: |Li+| and |Zn2+| work well (low activation barriers)

~~~~~~~~~
Questions
~~~~~~~~~

Comment Doron Aurbach): the problem is on the surface; interfacial resistance.
Chlorides are better than oxides, but still need work.
The only advantage is a metal anode.

Q: Coordination preferences?
    A: Coordination mixing/crossover.

    then add it into the device so Li is not consumed.

  - doesn't solve the problem of dendrite formation

~~~~~~~~~
Questions

Ceramic Interface (Ceramic Coated Separator) and Li-Ion Safety/Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Separators must be:

  - chemically stable
  - electrochemically stable
  - mechanically stable
  - thermally stable

- markets:

  - electric buses
  - Tesla
  - Nissan

- safety:

  - more important than long life or energy density

  - thermal conduction through separator is key cause of explosion

  - most problems caused by internal short in cell

  - shorting scenarios:

    - worst case: Al foil touches lithiated graphite

    - also bad: Al foil touches edge of Cu foil

  - if anode propagates the heat,
    then this heats up the rest of the cell

    - reduce thermal propagation of anode
    - reduce internal short

- ceramic coating (1μm - 5μm of aluminum oxide)

  - can't be oxidized like a polymer, so higher voltage is possible

  - many ways to coat it and construct it

~~~~~~~~~
Questions
~~~~~~~~~

Q: Porosity / transport?
    A: Slight difference, but DCR [?] is improved.
    Impedance is higher, but power density is improved.
    Keep cell from drying out.

Q: What is optimal thickness?
    A: Thinner compromises safety, but makes a better separator.

~~~~~~~~~
Questions
~~~~~~~~~

Q: We find that a polymer that works with one kind of silicon
won't work with others. Do you see that also?

A: Yes, 3D structure is always important,
as is interaction with silicon and other binders.

Q: Was the polymer fully lithiated?

A: I think we added LiOH to optimize,
but hard to know the number of functional groups.

Q: Was it to a particular pH, or stoichiometric?

A: Used molar mass to try to get ratio right.

Q: Lithated PAA is not self-healing, carboxylic acid.

A: Self-healing is bad on ion-dipole interaction,
for other cases we must check carefully.

      - shape change?

      - surface area increase?

- What's going on?

  - After cycling:

    - large increase in thickness (not reversible)

    - silicon inhomogeneity

  - Why?

    - silicon "dendrites" (pseudo-dendrites?)

    - silicon moving around

    - breaks the silicon bond

      - not a solid, becomes dissolved in Li

      - dragged along during Li extraction

    - slow kinetics even with FEC

  - HAADF STEM (EELS)

    - inhomogeneous lithiation (composition varies between particles)

    - kill off particles piece by piece

- SiN

  - keeps silicon still

  - LiN is a good ion conductor

  - thin film only (less than 200 nm)

  - working on powder form

Electrode Modifications By Polymeric Coatings for Enhanced Performances of Li-Ion Batteries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- SEI: charge transfer resistance

- electrolyte additives:

  - control SEI properties (indirectly)

  - but has to work for both anode and cathode

- artificial SEI (ex situ)

  - problems: requires high temp or high cost (e.g. ALD)

  - polymer: low temp, cheap, good for anode

    - past: conducting polymer ($$$)

    - binders

- graphite anodes are king, and will be for ten years, probably

- P&P coating makes graphite keep capacity, even at 10C

  - problem: only works with PVDF, but PVDF requires NMP
    and environmental concerns means companies
    are trying to use water-based slurries instead.

  - solution: cross-linked water-insoluble binder

  - next-gen: ternary polymic coating

- making it easier to add silicon (5-10%) to graphite

  - prevent segregation (Si tends to clump together)

  - uniform distribution of Si prevents capacity fade

  - 2% polymer + 1% carbon nanotubes

~~~~~~~~~
Questions
~~~~~~~~~

Q: Did the polymer actually fall off the particles?
    A: Yes, they were water-soluble.

Q: Polymer cost?
    A: Yes, low and reasonable

Q: Does it decrease impedance?
    A: Yes, charge-transfer resistance goes down dramatically.

Can We Control Polysulfide Formation and Migration?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- proposed solutions to sulfur migration

  - contain sulfur in micro/mesoporous structure

  - high electrolyte concentration / viscosity

  - better separator

    - ceramics work, but they are expensive and brittle

    - fluorinated graphite has similar performance to ceramic separator

    - functionalized reduced graphene oxide
 
- NMR, UV-Vis spectroscopy

- glass fiber separator

- XPS

- Focused ion beam / EDX

- Can we avoid polysulfide formation entirely?

  - long/mid/short chain polysulfides

  - Sulfur K-edge XANES

    - only transforms from |Li2S| to sulfure

    - linear combination fitting

  - BUT: dendrite formation still an issue at high currents

~~~~~~~~~
Questions
~~~~~~~~~

Q: What is the concentration? Can you reuse trapped polysulfides?
    A: Not trapped, they are repelled back by hydrophobicity.

Q: Do you see coloration of electrolyte?
    A: No.

Q: Does XAS show it is really |Li2S|?
    A: Hard to find a good standard; may not be stoichiometric, but is crystalline.
